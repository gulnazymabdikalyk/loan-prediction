# loan-prediction
In this project I analyse the loan prediction.  

The dataset is taken from the webpage of Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ninzaami/loan-predication.  

Loan prediction is a very common real problem that every retail bank faces at least once in its life.  If done correctly, it can save many man-hours at the end of the retail bank.  

The following data was used for analysis:  gender, marital status, education, number of dependants,  income, loan amount, credit history and others. 

The main library used for analysis is Pandas and Numpy.
